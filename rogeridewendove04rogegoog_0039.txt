than to notice where other historians ceased their
labours. Wendover informs his readers in his
text the years in which Marianus Scotus and
Sigehert of Gemblours ended their histories3 hut
such statements, we know, cannot imply that all
before those respective years was by their hand.
And so in the present instance, if the writer of
the Introduction will turn to Pits, edit. 1619,
p. 255, he will there read that John of Hagus·
taldt, or Hexham, continued his chronicle to
the first year of the reign of king Richard the
first, namely, 1189, a date which exactly tallies
with the marginal note. This is not offered as
the solution of the difficulty, although it would
appear to be a very simple and natural one.
'l'here is still a rather curious circumstance
connected with this point that is deserving our
consideration, tending, as it does, to shew that
the earlier os well as the later portions of the
chronicle were written hy the same hand. It
hasbeen before observed that Wendover in the

> first book of his chronicle has copied verbatim

many paragraphs from the Historia Scholastica
of Petrus Comestor3 and it is well known that
that writer died in 1178, and that the Historia
was written between 1169 and 1175. Douhtless,
then, copies of that work may have been sent into
England before 11803 but it appears from New·
come¹ that in the time of John of Studham‚ the
twenty-first abbot‚ who died in the year 1214, by
the industry of Raymond the prior a copy of

that hook was obtained for the lihrary of the
abhey3 and it is mentioned in such a manner as

would lead us to suppose that no other copy
had existed there before.
