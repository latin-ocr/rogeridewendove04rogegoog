The Chronicles, or, as they ere very properly {2135

entitled, Flores Historiarum, of this author, com·
prise an abridged history of the world from the
Creation to the year of our Seriour's Incarnation
1235, or the nineteenth year of Henry the third.
as correctly stated by Selden. The principal di-
vision os the work is into two parts or books, the
first extending srom the Creation to the birth of
the Saviour, the second from the Nativity to the
end of the period just mentioned. of these books
the first is subdivided into five parts or ages,
containing the history ol tbc world from Adam
to Noah3 from the Deluge to the birth of Abra·
bam; from Abraham to the death of Saul ; from
the accession ol David to the burning ol the
Temple and the destruction ol Jerusalem by Ne-
buchadnenzar3 end, lastly, lrom the Babylonisb
captivity to the birth of Christ. This book
was abridged by Mettbew of westminster, who
adopted the title and half the preface as his own:
it occupies the first forty peges of the edition ol
that author pubiisbed in 1601. The whole of
this, in conformity with the plan of publication
proposed by the English Historical Society, it
has been thought advisable to omit in the pre-
sent edition3 it contains merely an ebridgcd
history of the Old Testament, of the Jews, ol
the Persians under Cyrus and his successors,
and Egypt under the Ptolemies, compiled from
Petrus Comestor‚ Joscphus, Methodius, Jerome,
and other well known authorities The princi·
pal notices respecting Britain, both from the
romance ol Geoffrey of Monmouth, are to be
found in the narrative os its occupation by Bru-
tus, and in the history ol king Leir3 the latter Ἰ
of which, as the foundation of one oi the most
interesting perhaps of tbe plays of Shakspere,
is bere subjoined:
