rauracus. xxxiii

The lallacy iu the remaining argument oi the
editor, conclusive though hc calls it, is almost too
palpable to need exposure. It is drawn from an
assertion ol Paris himself, at the end ol the ac·
count of John's embassy to the emperor ol Mo·
rocco in 1213, where he sayS,‘ audiente Matthaeo,
qui et haec scripsit et narravit.' lt is certainly
clear lrom this that Paris did write the paragraph
in question, and probably the account which pre·
cedes it; but, until a MS. os Wendover be dis·
covered that contains either, it cannot be allow·
ed, os course, to have any weight.

It would not have been thought necessary to
say so much upon this point, bad not the state·
ments above referred to been adopted hythe Duc
de Luynes, and introduced in his prelace to the
translation ol Matthew Paris, lately published.
As this is likely to be, and deservedly so srorn
the very able manner in which it has been exe-
cuted, a standard work upon the Continent, it
bas been thought due te Wendover to set his
claims in their true light.

of the present edition, the first ol this writer
that bas ever issued irem the presa, a lew words
will suffice. The text is taken irem the only
manuscript of Weudover believed now to be ex-
tant, the property ol the late Mr. Douce, and
bequeatbed by him, with the rest olbis MSS.
and printed beokS, to the Bodleian library. It
is a solio volume on vellum, written in two
columns, almost at the close probably oi the thir-

teenth century. It is unfortunatcly imperfect in
two places: in one srom the year 879 to 894,
where the history has been continued in the text
from an excellent MS. of Matthew ot' Westmin·
ster, who fortunately at this point is an exact
copyist os Wendover, collated with the edition
