PREFACE. XXXV

A MS. ofWendover, commencing with the Na-
tivity, is spoken of in a note prelixed to a copy
of Matthew ol westminster, in tho Bodleian li·
brary [MS. Laud, 572], as having belonged to
Sir Christopher Heidon, knight, ol Norsolk, but
we have no means os ascertaining whether that
MS. is at present in existence or not. NicholS,
indeed, in his history ol Leicestershire, has made
the MSS. ol Weudover and Paris identical.

In the notes to the present edition the editor
has been anxious to say only so much as appear·
ed to he usesul sor the general purpose of il-
lustration, orto amend the chronology, which,
osten confused, owing to the different periods
at which the year was commenced by different
authors, or from inaccuracy, arising from the
scanty means of informatiou at the time, later
researches, and greater opportunities lor arriving
at the truth, have enabled him to correct.

lt only remains for him to add his best thanks
to Mr. Bentley lor the attention and expedition
with which the work has been passed through
the presS, as also to Mr. Fehon for· the great
carc with which the index has been compiled.

Oxford,
lo Nor. 1842.
