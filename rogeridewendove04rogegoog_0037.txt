dred, if not two hundred and fifty years after
Wendover’s death, and therefore is not to
be preferred in evidence to those MSS. of Mat-
thew Paris and Wendover, of a much earlier
period, which distinctly state, the one as quoted
by Wats in the Variae Lectiones, that in the
year 1234 ‘Dominus Rogerus de Wendovre,
prior aliquando de Beluvair, buc usque chronica
sua baec digessit. Incipit frater Matthaeus Pa-

can scarcely be a reasonable doubt, that, in the
S. Alban's MS. the word ‘secundi,' by an error

to signify so great au interval as fifty yearS,
namely, from 1170 to 1220, when ‘Matthaeus
Parisiensis claruit?

But the internal evidence to be deduced from
