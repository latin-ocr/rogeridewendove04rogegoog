year 1235 it has been written by another hand
· than thatoslllatthew Paris. The numerous in-
terpolations, the different circumstances related
connected with the same story,-those, sor in·
stance, amongst many others, in the account os
the visit 01 the archhishop os Armenia 10 Eng-
land in ¹1228, and the diametricallyopposite state·
ments 01 the one and the other in reference to
the plunder 01 S. Alban's in 1217? all concur 10
shew that Matthew Paris was not the writer 01
1110 chronicle in question3 and 11 so, to whom, 11
001 10 wendover, are we 1ο 1001 sor the author-

But to the second reason lor his conclusion
adduced hythe edituros Rishanger. He says
that in the Donce MS. ‘ there is a marginal note
stating, that at the year 11110 0 new chronicler
continued the work. On this point the editor
has been strangely misinsormed3 although, even il
there were such a note extant, we should be very
caresul how we received the testimony 01 0 much
later hand. The marginal note iu question,
however, is 10 hc sound at the commencement 01
the year 1189, and is as follows, ‘ Huc usquein
libro cronicarum Johannis abbatis.' lt is writ-
ten in very faint ink, or rather, as it appears,
with a kind 01 lead pencil, a writing with which
all who consult MSS. 01 the middle ages are
well acquainted‚ and has been hya still later
hand transcribed on the opposite margin thus,
‘Usque hoc cronica Johannis abbatis et hic
linis! But how are wc 10 conclude that all be·
lore this time was the work 01 abbot John, and
all since that year by another chroniclcrl No-
thing is more common with writers 01 chronicles
