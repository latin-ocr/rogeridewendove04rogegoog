011601ς and again the MS. is mutilated iu the
narrative of the events of the years 1191 and
1192, where the text has heen supplied srorn
what remains of the Wendover MS. destroyed
at the firc os Ashburnham Hense, now retained
in the various readings os Wats’ edition of Mat-
thew Paris.¹

Throughout the three last volumes the reader
will lind these variations carefully preserved,
that the present may form as complete an edi·
tion ol the work as it is at this day possible to
furnish.² Oi the history ol the MS. there exists
no positive information, further than that it was
purchased by Mr. Douce at the sale 01 books he-
longing to the late Sir John Sebright, in the
catalogue 01 which it is described as the Flores
Historiarum of Matthew os Westminster.

The editor os Rishanger indeed thinks that
‘thero can scarcely he any reasonable doubt that
the MS. in question is the same with one which, in
the year 1585, belonged to one Doctor Matthew
Carew,' and gives the following reason sor his opi·
nion, namely, that the transcriher os an extract
from this MS, now in the Sloaue collection, MS.
1301, ‘in copying the two linos oi poetry which
occur at the eud os the chronicle, not understand·
ing the word ‘tenuit’ as written in the manu·
script, has made a kind os sac-similo os the MS.
contraction3 and this corresponds with that in
the Douce manuscript! But it is inconceivahle
whence the editor can have derived his informa-
tiou, since, in the lines alluded to, with which our
history concludes, no such word as ‘tenuit' is to

he found!
