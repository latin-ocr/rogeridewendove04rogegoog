noem It is only left us to consider Wendover in his

iffi character as an historias, as it may he gathered
from his work and elsewhere. A manuscript
chartulary of S. Alban’s abhey, written at the
close of the fisteenth century, describes him es
the man to whom the historiens of England owe
nearly all which they have. In this chartulary‚
however, the scribebas committed an error in
stating that Wendover's history extended only so
far as to the reign of Heury the second; we
shall presently see that the third king of that
name is evidently intended. Bale speaks of him
as a man from his earliest years most eager in
his pur-suit of knowledge. Pits, from Stowe,
writes that he was a diligent searcher into those
things which were going on around him, and that
he carelnlly and honestly registered all the most
remarkable events of his time, which either he
had himself seen, or had received from trust-
worthy authority. Selden, in his notes upon
the Historiae Novorum of Eadmer,¹ observes,
that all the former part of the history of Mat·
tbew Paris, that namely from the Conouest to
the nineteenth year of Henry the third, is due
to Wendover.
