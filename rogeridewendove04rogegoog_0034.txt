atis, de loco ipso, uhi beati martyris effusus erat av· ⁴⁴0·
sanguis, massam pulveris secum portaturus abs-

as various astho subjects of which he treats.
He has gathered his‘ Flowers’ ru gardens at home
and abroad, and it is to be seared that many-
have suffered from having been too rudelyhandled.
Itis evident that in several places the sense has
been obsoured, if not corrupted, hy his anxiety to
compress his information into a small compass;
although, generally speaking, he hasbeen care·
sul to retain the words of the author whom he is
quoting. One of his principal authorities in
matters of foreign history appears to have been
Sigebert, the monh of Gemblours, from whom he
frequently transcribes verbatim whole passages
and who has very often been the cause os many
chronological errors which will be sound iu the
work. From Hermannus Contractus, Marianus
ScotuS, and the Byzantiue historiam, Theopha-
nes, Cedren, and others, he appears also to have
horrowed, whence, in the earlier parts os his
chronicle, his style naturally partakes more of
the character of those from whom he is copying3
at the same time that, where iu the compilation
he has moulded the material into his own form,
it will be found to be that of plain and unaffeot·
ed narrative. In the later portione of his his·
tory, the writers of his own land are the chief
sources of the events that he registers. Beda,
